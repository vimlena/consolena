# Consolena

![A picture of the different variations of Consolena with a pangram sentence and some various punctuation and symbols.](./consolena-variants.png)

Consolena is a monospace typeface with an emphasis on legibility and
consistency. Looks best at slightly higher point sizing than you are probably
using, in my tests 12.5–13.5 pt. Many screens are very high resolution these
days so you can still see a lot without straining your eyes. You can make your
text slightly larger, I believe in you.

It comes in four variants:

1. Regular width, no ligatures (Consolena)
2. Condensed width, no ligatures (ConsolenaC)
3. Regular width, has ligatures (ConsolenaL)
4. Condensed width, has ligatures (ConsolenaLC)

Consolena is based on [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/) by
Belleve Invis, specifically the SS04 DejaVu Sans Mono/Meslo stylistic set with
term spacing.

Not everybody likes ligatures, which is why I made versions that do not
have as well as versions that include ligatures. For versions that support
ligatures, I include most common ligatures except for the variations of `!=`
→ ≠ because I personally don’t like them.

The zero is not quite slashed or dotted, it’s basically a hybrid between the
two. I like the distinctiveness of a dotted zero, but not how it looks. I like
the look of a slashed zero, but don’t like how it can be confused with the
empty set character (∅) or the slashed zero character (Ø or ø) common in some
languages.
